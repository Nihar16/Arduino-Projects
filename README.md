## About This Repository

This repository contains a curated set of Arduino projects demonstrating various sensors, modules, and coding techniques. Each project includes:

- The complete source code (.ino files)
- Schematic diagrams and circuit descriptions
- Images and/or videos illustrating results (where applicable)
- Step-by-step instructions

**Objectives:**
- Learn and share knowledge about Arduino microcontrollers
- Document reusable code, functions, and hardware setups
- Support open source and collaboration in electronics prototyping
